                I worked on the Realtime Platform team at Facebook, supporting apps that provide realtime communication experiences to Facebook users. I worked on both cross-platform C++ and Objective-C libraries. I was the team's iOS expert and drove several projects to improve the platform and helped mentor other engineers.

                  Led an effort to dramatically reduce (~66%) the binary size impact of our main library by analyzing dependencies and factoring out some code into smaller libraries.

                <li>
                  Identified an opportunity to improve many of our APIs by making them asynchronous with improved error reporting. I broke the project into small tasks and then mentored a new engineer as they completed the work.

                  Identified and executed on opportunities to improve reliability, code quality, and test coverage of the platform.

                I spent most of my time at Clio on the iOS team, and served as team lead during my last year. Before that, I worked on various parts of the Ruby on Rails app, including the public REST API, feature work, and MySQL query performance.

                <li>
                  Made extensive improvements to the calendar feature, improving accuracy while dramatically improving performance. I don't have performance numbers here but, qualitatively, it went from being barely usable to running smoothly for Clio's biggest accounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Was a key contributor to the iOS code base in all areas, including networking, persistence, UI, testing, and CI maintenance.
